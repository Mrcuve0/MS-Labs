### **OTHER**

Please, refer to the badges "`development`" you can find at the top of each README, here's some additional infos:

1. [![DevelopmentStatus](https://img.shields.io/badge/Development-Ongoing-brightgreen.svg)](https://img.shields.io/badge/Development-Ongoing-brightgreen.svg)
> This means I'm currently enhancing/fixing the project. I'm open to suggestions and Pull Requests, that will be treated as soon as possible.
2. [![DevelopmentStatus](https://img.shields.io/badge/Development-Paused-yellow.svg)](https://img.shields.io/badge/Development-Paused-yellow.svg)
> This means I'm currently not considering the project as a top priority, hence issues and Pull Request will be still treated, but with higher delays. The development status can reach a higher priority ("Ongoing") or a lower one "Stopped" at any time.
3. [![DevelopmentStatus](https://img.shields.io/badge/Development-Stopped-red.svg)](https://img.shields.io/badge/Development-Stopped-red.svg)
> This means I'd prefer to consider this project abandoned. I could reconsider this development status only if some really big opportunities present itselves and really worth the effort. Issues and PR will be probably read but not considered.

*As a general rule*, take in mind that my entire [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Mrcuve0) (themes included!) is based on my sparse time and it is mainly passion-driven. As for now, *my number one priority* is finishing my **Master's Degree in Embedded Systems**: don't panic if I cannot reply to your issue even after a week, I'm probably really busy and I'm making already restless nights.
